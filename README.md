# Simple socket.io Chat

This uses express and socket.io to make a chat application.

## Usage

To set it up, clone the repository and `npm install` the node packages.  To run it, you can use `nodemon`:

```
nodemon index.js
```

You can open two browsers at:  http://localhost:4000/

Enter a handle and a message in each browser, and they will communicate with each other.
